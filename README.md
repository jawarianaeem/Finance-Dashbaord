# Finance-Dashbaord
This report outlines the process and insights from creating a financial dashboard using a dataset. The project involved analyzing financial data to derive key metrics and visualizing them through interactive charts to provide a comprehensive view of the company's performance. 

The dashboard provides insights into various financial aspects such as sales, profit margins, and expenses, enabling users to filter data by region, country, quarter, and year. Below is a detailed description of the steps taken and the visualizations created.

Data Analysis

The project started with an in-depth analysis of the provided financial dataset. The following financial metrics were calculated:

Gross Profit: Total revenue minus the cost of goods sold.

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA): Gross profit minus operating expenses.

Operating Profit: Profit from operations after subtracting operating expenses.

Profit by Income Tax: Operating profit minus income tax expenses.

Net Profit: The final profit after all expenses, taxes, and deductions.

A separate sheet for Profit and Loss was created to organize and present these calculations.

Dashboard Visualizations

To make the financial data more insightful and easy to interpret, several visualizations were created in the dashboard:

1. Bar Chart: Sales, Gross Profit, and Net Profit

This bar chart shows the comparison of sales, gross profit, and net profit over different time periods:

Yearly

Monthly

Quarterly

2. Area Chart: Gross Profit and EBITDA

An area chart was created to visualize the monthly trend of:

Gross Profit

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)

This chart helps identify patterns in the financial performance over time.

3. Area Chart: Sales and Marketing Expenses

Another area chart was developed to show the monthly trend of:

Sales

Marketing Expenses

This visualization highlights the relationship between sales revenue and the expenses incurred in marketing efforts.

4. Combined Line and Bar Chart: Gross Profit Margin and Net Profit Margin

This combined chart displays:

Gross Profit Margin (as a line chart)

Net Profit Margin (as a line chart)

Sales (as a bar chart)

The combination of line and bar charts in a single visualization provides a comprehensive view of profit margins alongside sales performance.

Filters

To enhance the usability of the dashboard, interactive filters were added:

Region

Country

Quarterly

Yearly

These filters allow users to focus on specific regions, countries, quarters, or years to gain deeper insights into financial performance.

Conclusion

The financial dashboard created in this project provides a comprehensive overview of key financial metrics and trends. The combination of various charts and interactive filters enables users to easily interpret the data and make informed decisions. By analyzing the dataset and presenting the insights visually, the dashboard serves as a powerful tool for financial analysis and reporting.
